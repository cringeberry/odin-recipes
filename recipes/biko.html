        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Biko is a Filipino rice cake made from sticky rice (locally known as malagkit), coconut milk, and brown sugar. Like other rice cakes, this is referred to as kakanin (derived from the word “kanin” which means rice) and is often eaten as dessert or meryenda (mid-afternoon snack).</p>
        <p>Traditionally, this delicious rice cake is placed over banana leaves in a bilao (round weaven bamboo tray) and garnished with latik (cooked coconut milk residue) on top. In addition, Biko is served during special occasions such as birthday parties, family reunions, and town fiestas.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups glutinous rice <em>aka sticky rice or malagkit</em></li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups coconut milk</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the sticky rice and water in a rice cooker and cook until the rice is ready (we intentionally combined lesser amount of water than the usual so that the rice will not be fully cooked).</li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, combine the coconut milk with brown sugar and salt in a separate pot and cook in low heat until the texture becomes thick. Stir constantly.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked and the coconut milk-sugar mixture is thick enough, add the cooked rice in the coconut milk and sugar mixture then mix well. Continue cooking until all the liquid evaporates (but do not overcook).</li>
            <li>Scoop the cooked biko and place it in a serving plate then flatten the surface.</li>
            <li>Share and Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
